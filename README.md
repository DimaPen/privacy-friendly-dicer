## Privacy Friendly Dicer
Privacy Friendly Dicer is a very simple dicing application and belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany. It can be used to roll up to 10 six-sided dice. This can be done either by pressing a button or by shaking the smartphone.

This app is optimized regarding the user's privacy. It doesn't use any tracking mechanisms, neither it displays any advertisement.
It only uses two permissions: Vibration for providing feedback whether dice were rolled or not and sensor to enable
the dicing by shaking.
